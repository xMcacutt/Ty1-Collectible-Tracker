# Ty the Tasmanian Tiger Collectible Tracker
This app provides a transparent screen overlay for displaying collectible counts from Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 1.

To get started, download the latest release and extract the files. Next, run the app. The collectible icons should appear on screen.
You can move the collectibles around your screen and their positions will be saved on exiting the app.

To change the settings or close the app, right click any of the collectibles or the white grab bar at the top middle of the screen.

Once all of a collectible or all of that collectible in the current level have been collected, a tick will appear to mark the collection.
